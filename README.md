## Project Context  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must all adapt and overcome the new ways of interaction and learning through electronic means. My application is aimed at all audiences who want to learn more about computers. A mobile application aimed at the use of Android Users. As of 2019 Android devices are responsible for 86.1% market share. I decided to create an android mobile application using the Android Studio IDE. All tools/languages are listed in the  'Development  Environment section in greater depth. Through development, each component was developed with an agile approach in mind delivering milestones weekly and described in my git commits history.
